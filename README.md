## Explanation about my approach and challenges faced during development
With the initial steps after receiving the assignment, I confirm my intention to undertake the project with your company. After that, I read the assignment and select the libraries and frameworks to be used. Next, I will build the file and folder structure before I start coding.

Regarding the challenges in completing this assignment, I believe that writing test cases for the project is something I have no experience with. I feel that I do not have enough capability or time to complete the unit test cases in the best way possible.
